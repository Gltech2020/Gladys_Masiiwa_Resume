       <p> <b>Gladys Masiiwa: Software Engineer</b>  </p>
       <p> Highly motivated graduate, always ready to take up a challenge. 
           My passion is in writing well designed, testable code, developing software 
           and meeting clientâ€™s needs. 
           Not only am I a great team player, I am equally able to work as 
           an individual where required. 
           I am not afraid of learning new things. In fact, 
           I enjoy learning and practicing using real life examples. 
           In Software engineering we learn everyday. </p>
           <p> I have completed modules in Introduction to Programming, Introduction to Software Engineering
                and Data Science, Algorithms and Advanced Software Engineering. 
                My assignments included real life challenging tasks that got me job ready. 
                Some of the projects I have done include Creating a Task Manager System, 
                a Simple Game and a Financial Calculator. </p>
                <p> Having completed a degree in English and Communication, I have a good command of the English language. 
                    This has put me in good stead in so far as understanding various practice materials at my disposal.</p>
